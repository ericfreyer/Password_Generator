In this assignment I had to create a random password generator that took in user criteria, and generated a random password. I allowed the user to chose the length and if they would like lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters within their password. Any combination of criteria will work, except if they chose none. If that's the case, then they are told to reload the page and start over. The same thing occurs if the length chosen is not between the values stated within the prompt (In this case 8-128 characters). The password is then displayed in the textbox upon clicking the generate button.
